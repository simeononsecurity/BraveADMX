### Proper ADMX Templates for the Brave Browser

As of the Brave Browser v1.3 (Feb 2020) release, Brave now has its own dedicated registry space seperate from Chrome and Chromium.

**These Policy Definitions are in a Pre-Alpha state. Not all policies are functional, but should work most of the time.**

**Download the required files from the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/simeononsecurity/BraveADMX)**

Modified Google Chrome Policy Definitions according to: [Brave Group Policy](https://support.brave.com/hc/en-us/articles/360039248271-Group-Policy)

**Note:**
Replaced "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Policies\Google\Chrome" with "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Policies\BraveSoftware\Brave"

## How to install

1.) Copy all files except readme.md to "C:\Windows\PolicyDefinitions" and/or "\\\domain.tld\domain\Policies\PolicyDefinitions"
2.) Profit?
